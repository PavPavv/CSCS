# Common notes

## What is machine organization?

Machine organization is a subset of computer architecture that covers low-level data types, internal CPU organization, memory organization and access, low-level machine operations, mass storage organization, peripherals, and how computers communicate with the rest of the world.

## What is great code?

The great code is:

- Uses the CPU efficiently (that is, it’s fast)
- Uses memory efficiently (that is, it’s small)
- Uses system resources efficiently
- Is easy to read and maintain
- Follows a consistent set of style guidelines
- Uses an explicit design that follows established software engineering conventions
- Is easy to enhance
- Is well tested and robust (that is, it works)
- Is well documented
